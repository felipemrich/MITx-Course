# PacMan Animation Exercise

An interactive PacMan animation exercise using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple PacMan animation where multiple PacMan characters move around the screen. PacMan changes direction and animates its mouth as it moves.

## Project Structure

### HTML File

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the button to add a new PacMan and the script reference.

### JavaScript File

- `pacman.js`: JavaScript code for the PacMan class, including methods for creating and animating PacMan characters.

### CSS File

- `styles2.css`: CSS styles for styling and positioning the button.

## PacMan Class

The `PacMan` class is responsible for creating and animating PacMan characters. It includes methods for randomizing PacMan's initial position, creating the HTML element dynamically, and updating its position and appearance during animation.

## Usage

Click the "Add PacMan" button to add a new PacMan character to the screen. The PacMan characters will move around randomly, changing direction when reaching the screen edges.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the PacMan animation.
