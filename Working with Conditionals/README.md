Name: Working with Conditionals

Description: In this activity i coded in JavaScipt to create a function that checks if the conditional is true or false using if statments and booleans.
First, i created a variable with no value, because the value will be assign inside the function. Inside the function i created an if statment that return if input is older than 18 or not!

Installation: You can try this in your browser, terminal or any text editor you prefer. I am using VS Code. 

Usage: This activity it is usefull for creating a simple conditional using if
