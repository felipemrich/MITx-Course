Name: Scope

Description: In this activity i coded in JavaScipt the lesson we learn here is what is the scope in a function. If you declare let in a function, this variable just exist inside the function.
If you try to use this variable (let) that you created inside the function outside the function it won't worked.

Installation: You can try this in your browser, terminal or any text editor you prefer. I am using VS Code. 

Usage: This activity it is usefull for understanding the function scope and how thinks work when you have 1 variable (let) outside the function and another inside. The function will use the variable created inside the function if they have the same name
