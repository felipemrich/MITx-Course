Name: PACMAN

Description: In this activity i coded in JavaScipt to create the game PACMAN. This game is not finished, the only think that this code does is simulating the pacman movements and change direction when reaches the edge of the screen
To do that i created a variable to position and set his value to 0, another variable to get the page width, the pacman is going horizontal only,
I created other 2 variables called focus and direction
After that i created a 2 dimention array that will be used for the pacman animation
Finally i created a function that check if the image hits the edge and when it hits change his direction

Installation: You can try this in your browser, terminal or any text editor you prefer. I am using VS Code. 

Usage: This activity it is usefull for creating an animation using javascript. In this case we are creating pacman's movement
