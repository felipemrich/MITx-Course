Name: GRAPHICS ANIMATION OF THE RANDOM WALK

Description: In this activity i coded in JavaScipt to create a random walk animation. 
To do that i started creating an object called Area, 
Them i initialize my function creating a div on the html file,
After that i created a function moveTo for moving a given ball to a set x and y coordinates on the page,
The ideia was to change the ball's direction when hits the edge if the screen, so i created another function to change direction when necessary,
To do the assingment i also need to create the ball to walk random, so i did it using another function with 3 inputs(color, dx, dy).
After that i created a function called update that call other function to walk random. I used setTimeOut to reapeat the process over and over,
To test it i called initialized function, and created 3 balls

Installation: You can try this in your browser, terminal or any text editor you prefer. I am using VS Code. 

Usage: This activity it is usefull for learning how to create an animation using javascript
